Usage:
    $script <command>

Available commands:
    name     Print out the name of the HTTP proxy container.
    status   Print out the status of the HTTP proxy container.
    start    Start the HTTP proxy container, creating it if necessary.
    stop     Stop the HTTP proxy container.
    rm       Destroy a stopped HTTP proxy container, including its volumes.

Description:
    $script is a wrapper to easily manage the meanbee/nginx-proxy docker
    container. The container itself (extended from jwilder/nginx-proxy)
    accepts incomming HTTP and HTTPS requests and passes them to the
    appropriate docker container based on the request Host header.

    For HTTPS requests, the container uses an appropriate SSL certificate
    mounted from $certs_dir.

    For more information on the docker HTTP proxy container, see
    https://github.com/meanbee/docker-nginx-proxy and https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy
